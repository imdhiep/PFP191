Writing programs (or programming) is a very creative and rewarding activity.
You can write programs for many reasons ranging from making your living to solving a difficult data analysis
problem to having fun to helping someone else solve a problem.
This book assumes that everyone needs to know how to program and that once you know how to program,
you will figure out what you want to do with your newfound skills. Our computers are fast and have
vast amounts of memory and could be very helpful to us if we only knew the language to speak to explain
to the computer what we would like it to do next.  If we knew this language we could tell the computer
to do tasks on our behalf that were repetitive. Interestingly, the kinds of things computers can do best
are often the kinds of things that we humans find boring and mind-numbing.
