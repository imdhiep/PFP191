Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. 
Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming and metaobjects).
Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming.
Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.
It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.
Its design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition.
It has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.
The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.
